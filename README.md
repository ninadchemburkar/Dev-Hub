#Dev-Hub

MERN Stack Application

- The website contains a landing page consisting of SIGNUP and Login. It also has developer tab on landing page where it shows profile of the users and other developers of the website without registering in website.

- The Profile image comes from Gravitor. Also, I added field & skills in the profile page and when you click view profile it takes you to the full profile. There is social links that takes to the developers social media profiles and there is Bio Tab, Skill Tab where you can see the details of the person.

- There are also tabs that describe job experience, eduaction background, and company where user or developer currently working in. They also have Github user repository tab.

- After registration and logging in we land on dashboard which contain edit profile, experience, and education tab for the user where we have an option to add deatils and delete it. Also, user get an option to delete his account.

- It also have an alert Reducer within Redux where we can easily set and remove alerts which are displayed when user create, update, delete, and modify the profile and after few seconds alert goes automatically.

- Once you logged in you also get a post tab where you can see the latest post that you submitted and also other user's post. Also featured option is created to start discussion on the commented post.

- Inside the post user gets an option to like and dislike a post with the notification number over to convey number of discussion held inside that post. The posted topic has a time stamp and the logged in user's have an option to delete their own post anytime.
